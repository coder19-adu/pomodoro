# Pomodoro - Study With Me

A modern, minimalist Pomodoro Timer web application that helps you stay focused and productive using the Pomodoro Technique. This application combines a timer with task management features to help you track your work sessions and breaks effectively.

## What is the Pomodoro Technique?

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo. It uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a "pomodoro", the Italian word for tomato, after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer Cirillo used as a university student.

## How it Works

- The timer follows a cycle where - pomodoro (25mins) > short break (5mins) - this repeats 4 times and then it is followed by a long break (10mins).
-  Once started, the timer works on its own by following the cycle until it is invoked to stop.
